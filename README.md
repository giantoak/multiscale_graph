To Do List:

1.  Graph load function is definitely repeated twice.
2.  Would be nice to generalize isConnected and the graph coloring to more than one hop to correspond to scan statistic parameter (k).
3.  Would like the color by eigenvector centrality, betweeness to transition after box is clicked rather than reloaded.  I know this can be done using transition and duration with d3.
